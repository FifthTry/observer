# observer
Observability for rust servers


# Today

- [ ] verify it checks/runs
- [ ] document the output somewhere
- [ ] see how output looks when observed functions are nested
- [ ] cleanup repo, delete everything that was experiment


- [ ] `observed` should use function name by default

# Later

- [ ] how to make function names unique?
- [ ] integrate with newrelic stuff
- [ ] Queue trait to be stored on context object3
